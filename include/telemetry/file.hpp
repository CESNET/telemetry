 * with the application component in some other way. The class provides a number of optional
 * I/O operations (callbacks) that can be implemented and the visitor can use.
 *
 * @warning
 *   If an object is referenced within I/O operations (callbacks), it must be released or
 *   otherwise destroyed after this file instance. There is a risk that, in the case of
 *   an asynchronous request, the object may be accessed during its destruction. If the
 *   correct order of release/destruction cannot be guaranteed, the disable() function can
 *   be used to block I/O operations (callbacks) from being called.
